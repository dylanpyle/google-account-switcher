# Google Account Switcher - Chrome Extension

![](https://cloudup.com/cyJjfBoSuhb+)

If you use multiple Google accounts across products like Calendar, Drive, etc,
you're probably tired of manually clicking into the menu to switch between them.

This extension adds a simple keyboard shortcut - just press `Ctrl+[number]` to
switch to a different account. Accounts are numbered in the order you logged
into them.

## Installation

- Visit `chrome://extensions/`
- Enabled "developer mode" (top right)
- Click "load unpacked"
- Find this directory
